The first game (obviously) of the game challenge.

### Concept
You are a lonely cannon on a mission to save the world form the evil targets.

Use mouse or touch controls to set up the power and radius of the bullets. Release when satisfied and watch your bullet destroy the targets. Bullets are limited to five per level, so use them wisely.
One bullet can destroy multiple targets and will vanish when it's velocity becomes zero or when it leaves the map.
